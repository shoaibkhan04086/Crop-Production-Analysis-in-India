# Crop Production Analysis in India

## Overview
This project analyzes crop production trends in India, utilizing historical data to identify key factors influencing yields.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information on crop production across various states and districts in India, including:
- **State Name**
- **District Name**
- **Crop Year**
- **Season**
- **Crop**
- **Area (hectares)**
- **Production (tons)**

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Crop Production**: Overall yield across all regions.
2. **Average Yield per Hectare**: Efficiency of land use.
3. **Area Under Cultivation**: Total land used for crop cultivation.
4. **Production by Crop**: Breakdown of total production by crop type.
5. **Production by State/District**: Crop output by region.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations in Power BI to demonstrate insights from the data.
